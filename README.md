# HorseRaceSimulator
This horse race simulator uses different GUI's to allow any users to navigate freely and be as creative as they would like.

When the Main GUI opens you will be greeted with a hello message, on this same GUI you will have 4 options, Distance, Start Race, View Stats and Add Horse.

Initially, if the Start Race button is clicked a message will be displayed letting you know that you haven't chosen a distance or added a horse.

This error message will be displayed until 2 horses are added.

When you click the Distance button it will redirect you to another GUI which will ask you to pick one of three options 10m, 15m, and 20m this will set the distance for the track.

When a user clicks submit they are taken back to the Main GUI.

When the add horse button is clicked a user will be directed to an Addhorse GUI, the user will be asked to enter a horse name and a horse symbol and they will be required to slide the slider to set the confidence.

Confidence just determines how quick the horse will be and how likely it is to fall. essentially the higher the confidence the faster the horse and the higher the likelihood of falling and vice-versa.

After the submit button is pressed you are once again directed to the main GUI which once two horses are filled out you are now able to press the start race button.

At the end of the race, one of two outcomes will occur the horse whose name will be displayed or it will say no winners as all horses have fallen.
